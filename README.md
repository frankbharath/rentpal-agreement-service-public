## Introduction
The inception of the computer has revolutionized the way we approach a problem. An example could be, as a student in a foreign country, I had to renew my visa. The process was not easy as I had to get an appointment which was very tough to book. After having the appointment, I had to make sure that I have all the documents with me. Unfortunately, I had a document missing that denied my visa and I had to wait for another 45 days to book an appointment.

But fortunately, now everything has moved online, all I had to do is create an online account, apply for the visa, and upload all the necessary documents. Even if there is a document missing I will get a message from the visa office, asking me to upload the file. This process is fairly simple when compared to the previous approach.

Even though there is technology advancement in a lot of areas, there are few areas where we could do better with existing technologies. One of the areas is sharing of rental agreement and rent receipts.

## Problems and proposed solution
When I came to Paris, I got an accommodation and the owner gave me 4 sheets of rental agreement. I was with 2 other roommates and they also got the same. The question we asked to ourselves was the point of getting a rental agreement that is bound to expire within 1 year. During the year of 2018-2019, there were around 358,000 internation students who came to study in france, according to campus france. Now lets do a little math here, let us consider 200,000 students took an accommodation and they received a rental agreement for 3 pages. So in total 600,000 papers required. Moreover, the lease agreement could for 6 months or 1 year. After that there is no usage of these 600,000 papers. Now this calculation is just for international students, think about the local students who move to different cities, foriegners who come to france for work purpose, the tally could be little bit higher. Also, let us think about the other countries who take international students and now the tally becomes much more. 

Now can we do this in a better way? I think we can and use the concept of electronic signature. A owner and tenant can create an contract by signing electronically. The electronic copy will be saved in a server. Whenever the owner or tenant needs to access agreement, they can view document from UI interface. The tenant can share the agreement via email and can revoke access anytime.
