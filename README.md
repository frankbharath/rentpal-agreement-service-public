## Introduction
The inception of the computer has revolutionized the way we approach a problem. An example could be, as a student in a foreign country, I had to renew my visa. The process was not easy as I had to get an appointment which was very tough to book. After having the appointment, I had to make sure that I have all the documents with me. Unfortunately, I had a document missing that denied my visa and I had to wait for another 45 days to book an appointment.

But fortunately, now everything has moved online, all I had to do is create an online account, apply for the visa, and upload all the necessary documents. Even if there is a document missing I will get a message from the visa office, asking me to upload the file. This process is fairly simple when compared to the previous approach.

Even though there is technology advancement in a lot of areas, there are few areas where we could do better with existing technologies. One of the areas is sharing of rental agreement and rent receipts.
